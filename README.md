# ZX-Interface-1-Replacement-ROM-Programming-Adapter
Programming adapter for the ZX Interface 1 Replacement ROM

This is the programming adapter that is required to allow reprogramming of the ZX Interface 1 Replacement ROM.
You need to link J1 Pins 1-9 on both the adapter PCB and the ROM PCB and select the correct SST39SF device on the programmer.

It can also be used to reprogram the Retroleum 24-pin switchable ROM replacement module with a bit of faffing about.
